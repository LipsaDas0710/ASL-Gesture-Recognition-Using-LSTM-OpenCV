# ASL-Gesture-Recognition-Using-LSTM-OpenCV
This AI/ML-based project recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures like "Hello", "Thank You", and "I Love You" in real time. It uses OpenCV for detecting hand and face gestures from live video and an LSTM-based neural network to understand gesture sequences. The model is trained on a video dataset of ASL gestures and converts recognized gestures into their textual meaning, offering a smooth and intuitive communication experience.
