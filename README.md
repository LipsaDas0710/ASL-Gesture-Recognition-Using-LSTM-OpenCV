# ASL-Gesture-Recognition-Using-LSTM-OpenCV
This AI/ML-based project recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures like "Hello", "Thank You", and "I Love You" in real time. It uses OpenCV for detecting hand and face gestures from live video and an LSTM-based neural network to understand gesture sequences.
